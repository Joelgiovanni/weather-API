# About

A React app that uses a users Zip code of choice to return a 5 day forecast of a U.S. City. Axios is used to make these calls.
The JSON data that I use is retrieved from https://openweathermap.org/api. Icons are from https://websygen.github.io/owfont/.
The main purpose of this app was to test my javascript skills and my ability to manipiulate JSON data from API calls

## Live Demo
